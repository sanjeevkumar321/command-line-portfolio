My name is Sanjeev Kumar. I am a full stack software developer based in New Delhi, India. I have more than three years of experience in building web applications using both front-end and back-end technologies. My phone number is +91-9876543210 and my email address is sanjeev.kumar@example.com. My professional portfolio and code samples can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/sanjeevkumar-dev and on LinkedIn at https://linkedin.com/in/sanjeevkumar-dev.

I specialize in Java development. On the back end, I work with Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Hibernate to build scalable RESTful APIs and microservices. On the front end, I use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js and Angular to design responsive and user-friendly interfaces. I have experience working with both relational and NoSQL databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I use Spring Security and JWT to secure APIs and handle authentication and authorization. I have deployed applications to cloud environments such as AWS EC2 and Heroku, and use tools like Docker, Jenkins, and Git for DevOps and automation.

Since January 2022, I have been working as a Software Developer at TechNova Solutions Private Limited in Gurugram, India. In this role, I have led the development of key web applications for the finance and HR sectors, collaborated in Agile teams, improved backend performance by optimizing database queries, and implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker. Prior to that, I completed a six-month internship at CodeNest Technologies in Noida from July 2021 to December 2021, where I worked as a Java Developer Intern. During the internship, I supported development tasks, wrote Java and JSP code, and helped test and debug enterprise features.

I have also developed personal projects. One of them is an online bookstore built with Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL. It features user login, book browsing, a shopping cart, order processing, and Razorpay payment integration. Another project is an employee management system built with React, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. It allows CRUD operations on employee data and includes search, pagination, and secure login. I deployed the backend to Heroku and the frontend to Netlify. I also created a weather dashboard using JavaScript and the OpenWeather API to display real-time weather data for global cities.

I graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. I achieved a CGPA of 8.2 out of 10. To further strengthen my skills, I earned certifications in Java Programming from Oracle in 2020, Spring Framework from Udemy in 2021, and Full Stack Web Development from Coursera in 2022.

I regularly use Git and GitHub for version control, Maven for Java builds, Postman for API testing, and JIRA for Agile project tracking. I enjoy solving programming challenges, learning new technologies, and building clean, efficient, and maintainable software that solves real-world problems. I am now seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills in full stack development to create scalable, secure, and modern web applications.
